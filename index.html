              <div class="answer">
                Private mortgage lending provides loans secured by real estate to borrowers who (a) don’t qualify with traditional lenders, or (b) require financing fast with limited paperwork.  Lending approvals are focussed on the property’s value rather than the borrower’s income and credit history.

              </div>
              <div class="answer">
                A private mortgage lender is a non-bank (or credit union) lender who provides mortgage loans based on a property’s equity.  These lenders can be pooled funds like Mortgage Investment Corporations (MICs), Trust Companies, Private Individuals, or Private Companies.  They are bound by ethics, but not banking regulations, allowing them to provide more flexible terms and faster approvals.
